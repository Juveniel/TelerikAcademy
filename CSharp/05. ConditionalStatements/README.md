#Conditional Statements

## Exercises

### Task 1:
Write an if-statement that takes two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
### Task 2:
Write a program that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it. Use a sequence of if operators.
### Task 3:
Write a program that finds the biggest of three integers, using nested if statements.
### Task 4:
Sort 3 real numbers in descending order. Use nested if statements.
### Task 5:
Write a program that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English). Use a switch statement.
### Task 6:
Write a program that gets the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation: ax2 + bx + c, calculates and prints its real roots (if they exist). Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
### Task 7:
Write a program that finds the greatest of given 5 numbers.
### Task 8:
Write a program that, depending on the user’s choice, inputs int, double or string variable. If the variable is int or double, the program increases it by 1. If the variable is a string, the program appends "*" at the end. Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.
### Task 9:
We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds those subsets whose sum is 0.
*  If we are given the numbers {3, -2, 1, 1, 8}, the sum of -2, 1 and 1 is 0.
*  If we are given the numbers {3, 1, -7, 35, 22}, there are no subsets with sum 0.

### Task 10:
Write a program that applies bonus points to given scores in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
*  If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
*  If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
*  If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
*  If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints an error message.

### Task 11*:
Write a program that converts a number in the range [0…999] to words, corresponding to the English pronunciation.
