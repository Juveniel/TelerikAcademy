# Operators and Expressions

## Exercises

### Task 1: 
Write an expression that checks whether an integer is odd or even.

### Task 2:
Write a Boolean expression that checks whether a given integer is divisible by both 5 and 7, without a remainder.

### Task 3:
Write an expression that checks for a given integer if its third digit (right to left) is 7.

### Task 4:
Write an expression that checks whether the third bit in a given integer is 1 or 0.

### Task 5:
Write an expression that calculates the area of a trapezoid by given sides a, b and height h.

### Task 6:
Write a program that prints on the console the perimeter and the area of a rectangle by given side and height entered by the user.

### Task 7:
The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth. Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight on the Earth.

### Task 8:
Write an expression that checks for a given point {x, y} if it is within the circle K[{0, 0}, R=5]. Explanation: the point {0, 0} is the center of the circle and 5 is the radius.

### Task 9:
Write an expression that checks for given point {x, y} if it is within the circle K[{0, 0}, R=5] and out of the rectangle [{-1, 1}, {5, 5}]. Clarification: for the rectangle the lower left and the upper right corners are given.

### Task 10:
 Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 2011) and performs the following actions:
 
 * Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2+0+1+1 = 4).
 * Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 1102).
 * Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201).
 * Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 2101).
 
### Task 11:
We are given number n and position p. Write a sequence of operations that prints the value of the bit on the position p in the number (0 or 1). 
 
* Example: n=35, p=5 -> 1. 
* Another example: n=35, p=6 -> 0.

### Task 12:
Write a Boolean expression that checks if the bit on position p in the integer v has the value 1. 
  
* Example v=5, p=1 -> false.
  
### Task 13:
We are given the number n, the value v (v = 0 or 1) and the position p. write a sequence of operations that changes the value of n, so the bit on the position p has the value of v. 
  
* Example: n=35, p=5, v=0 -> n=3. 
* Another example: n=35, p=2, v=1 -> n=39.
  
### Task 14:
Write a program that checks if a given number n (1 < n < 100) is a prime number (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
  
### Task 15*:
Write a program that exchanges the values of the bits on positions 3, 4 and 5 with bits on positions 24, 25 and 26 of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
