# Loops

## Exercises

### Task 1:
Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N. The number N should be read from the standard input.
### Task 2:
Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N, which are not divisible by 3 and 7 simultaneously. The number N should be read from the standard input.
### Task 3:
Write a program that reads from the console a series of integers and prints the smallest and largest of them.
### Task 4:
Write a program that prints all possible cards from a standard deck of cards, without jokers (there are 52 cards: 4 suits of 13 cards).
### Task 5:
Write a program that reads from the console number N and print the sum of the first N members of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, …
### Task 6:
Write a program that calculates N!/K! for given N and K (1<K<N).
### Task 7:
Write a program that calculates N!*K!/(N-K)! for given N and K (1<K<N).
### Task 8:
Write a program that calculates the nth Catalan number by given n.
### Task 9:
Write a program that for a given integers n and x, calculates the sum: S = 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + … + N!/XN
### Task 10:
Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (N < 20) and prints a matrix 
### Task 11:
Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number ends.
* N = 10 -> N! = 3628800 -> 2
* N = 20 -> N! = 2432902008176640000 -> 4

### Task 16:
Write a program that by a given integer N prints the numbers from 1 to N in random order.
### Task 17:
Write a program that given two numbers finds their greatest common divisor (GCD) and their least common multiple (LCM). You may use the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).
### Task 18*:
Write a program that for a given number n, outputs a matrix in the form of a spiral
