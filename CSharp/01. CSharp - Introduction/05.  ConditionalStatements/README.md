## 05. Conditional Statements

Implementing Control Logic in C#

#### [01. Exchange numbers](01.%20ExchangeNumbers)
 - Write a program that reads two double values from the console A and B, stores them in variables and exchanges 
 their values if the first one is greater than the second one. Use an if-statement. 
 
#### [02. Bonus Score](02.%20BonusScore)

  Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1â€¦9] by the following rules:
   - If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
   - If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
   - If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
   - If the score is less than 0 or more than 9, the program prints "invalid score".
#### [03. Play card](03.%20PlayCard)
 - Classical play cards use the following signs to designate the card face: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and A. Write a program t
 hat enters a string and prints "yes CONTENT_OF_STRING" if it is a valid card sign or "no CONTENT_OF_STRING" otherwise.
 
#### [04. Multiplication sign](04.%20MultiplicationSIgn)
 - Write a program that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it.
 
#### [05. Biggest of 3](05.%20BiggestOfThree)
 - Write a program that finds the biggest of three numbers that are read from the console.
 
#### [06. Biggest of 5](06.%20BiggestOfFive)
 - Write a program that finds the biggest of 5 numbers that are read from the console, using only 5 if statements.
 
#### [07. Sort 3 Numbers](07.%20SortNumbers)
 - Write a program that enters 3 real numbers and prints them sorted in descending order.
 
#### [08. Digit as Word](08.%20DigitAsWord)
 - Write a program that read a digit [0-9] from the console, and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English).
 
#### [09. Int, Double, String](09.%20IntDoubleString)

  Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an int, double or string variable.
   - If the variable is int or double, the program increases it by one.
   - If the variable is a string, the program appends * at the end.
   - Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.
