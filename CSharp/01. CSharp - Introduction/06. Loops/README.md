## 06. Loops

Execute blocks of code multiple times

#### [01. Numbers from 1 to N](01.NumbersOneToN)
  - Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to N 
  inclusive, on a single line, separated by a whitespace.
#### [02. Not divisible numbers](02.NotDivisibleNumbers)
  - Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer N and prints all the numbers from 1 to N 
  not divisible by 3 or 7, on a single line, separated by a space.
#### [03. MMSA](03.MMSA)
  - Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N real numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal 
  number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).
#### [04. Print cards deck](04.PrintCardsDeck)
  - Write a program that reads a card sign(as a string) from the console and generates and prints all possible cards 
  from a standard deck of 52 cards up to the card with the given sign(without the jokers). The cards should be printed
  using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
#### [05. Calculation](05.Claculation)
  - Write a program that, for a given two numbers N and x, calculates the sum S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + … + N!/xN.
#### [06. Factorial calculation](06.FactorialCalculation)
  - Write a program that calculates N! / K! for given N and K.
#### [07. Factorial expression](07.FactorialExpression)
  - In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose N different members out of a group of N different elements
  (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: formula For example, there are 
  2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards. Your task is to write a program that calculates
  N! / (K! * (N - K)!) for given N and K.
#### [08. Catalan numbers](08.CatalanNumbers)
  -  Write a program to calculate the Nth Catalan number by given N
#### [09. Matrix of numbers](09.MatrixOfNumbers)
  - Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N and prints a matrix like in the examples
  below. Use two nested loops.
#### [10. Odd and even product](10.OddAndEvenProduct)
  - You are given N integers (given in a single line, separated by a space).
  - Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements.
  - Elements are counted from 1 to N, so the first element is odd, the second is even, etc.
#### [11. Binary to decimal](11.BinaryToDecimal)
  - Using loops write a program that converts a binary integer number to its decimal form.
#### [12. Decimal to binary](12.DecimalToBinary)
  - Using loops write a program that converts an integer number to its binary representation.
#### [13. Decimal to hex](13.DecimalToHex)
  - Using loops write a program that converts an integer number to its hexadecimal representation.
#### [14. Hex to decimal](14.HexToDecimal)
  - Using loops write a program that converts a hexadecimal integer number to its decimal form.
#### [15. Greatest common divisor](15.GreatestCommonDivisor)
  - Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of given two integers A and B.
#### [16. Trailing zeros](16.TrailingZeroes)
  -  Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number N has at its end.
#### [17. Sprial matrix](17.SpiralMatrix)
  - Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20) and prints a matrix 
  holding the numbers from 1 to N*N in the form of square spiral like in the examples below.
