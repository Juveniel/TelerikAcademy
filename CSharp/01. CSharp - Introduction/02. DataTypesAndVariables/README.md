## 02. Data Types and Variables

Primitive data types (`int`, `short`, `byte`, `long`, `bool`, `string`, `char`), creating and using variables

### Problem List

#### [01. Declare Variables](01.%20DeclareVariables)
 - Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000. Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
#### [07. Quotes in Strings](07.%20QuotedString)
 - Write a program that outputs The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.
#### [09. Isosceles Triangle](08.%20IsoscelesTriangle)
 - Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols `©`, something like this:
```
   ©
   
  © ©
  
 ©   ©
 
© © © ©
```
#### [13. Comparing Floats](13.%20ComparingFloats)
 - Write a program that safely compares two floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
#### [14. Print the ASCII Table](14.%20PrintASCII)
 - Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the visible characters of the ASCII table on the console (characters from 33 to 126 including).
