### Problem List

1. [Declare Variables](./01. DeclareVariables)
 - Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000. Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
1. [Quotes in Strings](./07. QuotedString)

 ©   ©
 
© © © ©
```
1. [Comparing Floats](./13. ComparingFloats)
 - Write a program that safely compares two floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
1. [Print the ASCII Table](./14. PrintASCII)
