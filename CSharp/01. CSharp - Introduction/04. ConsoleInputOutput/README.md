## 03. Console Input/Output

Reading and Writing to the Console

#### [01. Sum of 3 numbers](01.%20SumOfThreeNum)
 - Write a program that reads 3 real numbers from the console and prints their sum.
#### [02. Company info](02.%20CompanyInfo)
 - Write a program that reads the information about a company and its manager and prints it back on the console.
#### [03. Circle](03.%20Circle)
 - Write a program that reads from the console the radius r of a circle and prints its perimeter and area, rounded and 
 formatted with 2 digits after the decimal point.
#### [04. Formatting Numbers](04.%20FormattingNumbers)
 - Write a program that reads 3 numbers. The program then prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters.
#### [05. Number Comparer](05.%20NumberComparer)
 - Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them.
#### [06. Quadratic Equation](06.%20QuadraticEquation)
 - Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).
#### [07. Sum of 5 numbers](07.%20SumOfFiveNumbers)
 - Write a program that reads 5 integer numbers from the console and prints their sum.
#### [08. Numbers from 1 to N](08.%20NumbersOneToN)
 - Write a program that reads an integer number N from the console and prints all the numbers in the interval [1, n], each on a single line.
#### [09. Sum of N Numbers](09.%20SumOfNumbers)
 - Write a program that enters a number N and after that enters more N numbers and calculates and prints their sum.
#### [10. Fibonacci Numbers](10.%20FibonacciSequence)
 - Write a program that reads a number N and prints on the console the first N members of the Fibonacci sequence
#### [11. Interval](11.%20Interval)
 - Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers N and M and prints how many numbers exist between them such that the reminder of the division by 5 is 0.
#### [12. Falling Rocks](12.%20Falling%20rocks)
 Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console.
	- A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys).	
	- A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash.	
	- Rocks are the symbols `^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, -` distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is `(O)`.
 Ensure a constant game speed by `Thread.Sleep(150)`.
 Implement collision detection and scoring system.
