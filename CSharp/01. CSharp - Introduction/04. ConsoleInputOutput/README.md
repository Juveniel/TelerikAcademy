## 03. Console Input/Output

Reading and Writing to the Console

### Problem List

1. [Sum of 3 numbers](./01. SumOfThreeNum)
 - Write a program that reads 3 real numbers from the console and prints their sum.
1. [Company info](./02. CompanyInfo)
 - Write a program that reads the information about a company and its manager and prints it back on the console.
1. [Circle](./03. Circle)
 - Write a program that reads from the console the radius r of a circle and prints its perimeter and area, rounded and 
 formatted with 2 digits after the decimal point.
1. [Formatting Numbers](./04. FormattingNumbers)
 - Write a program that reads 3 numbers. The program then prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters.
1. [Number Comparer](./05. NumberComparer)
 - Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them.
1. [Quadratic Equation](./06. QuadraticEquation)
 - Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).
1. [Sum of 5 numbers](./07. SumOfFiveNumbers)
 - Write a program that reads 5 integer numbers from the console and prints their sum.
1. [Numbers from 1 to N](./08. NumbersOneToN)
 - Write a program that reads an integer number N from the console and prints all the numbers in the interval [1, n], each on a single line.
1. [Sum of N Numbers](./09. SumOfNumbers)
 - Write a program that enters a number N and after that enters more N numbers and calculates and prints their sum.
1. [Fibonacci Numbers](./10. FibonacciSequence)
 - Write a program that reads a number N and prints on the console the first N members of the Fibonacci sequence
1. [Interval](./11. Interval)
 - Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers N and M and prints how many numbers exist between them such that the reminder of the division by 5 is 0.
1. [Falling Rocks](./12. Falling rocks)
 Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console.
	- A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys).	
	- A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash.	
	- Rocks are the symbols `^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, -` distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is `(O)`.
 Ensure a constant game speed by `Thread.Sleep(150)`.
 Implement collision detection and scoring system.
