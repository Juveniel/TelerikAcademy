Logical, Arithmetic and Bitwise operators, expressions

### Problem List

1. [Odd or Even](./01. OddOrEven)
 - Reads an integer number from the console.
 - Stores in a variable if the number can be divided by 7 and 5 without remainder.
 - Prints on the console "true NUMBER" if the number is divisible without remainder by 7 and 5. Otherwise prints "false NUMBER". In place of NUMBER print the value of the input number.

1. [Moon Gravity](./02. MoonWeight)
 - Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight W(as a floating-point number) on the Earth.
 
1. [Divide by 7 and 5](./03. DivisionBySevenAndFive)
 - Write a program that reads an integer from the console, uses an expression to check if given integer is odd or even, and prints "even NUMBER" or "odd NUMBER", where you should print the input number's value instead of NUMBER.
 
1. [Rectangles](./04. Rectangles)
 - Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given width and height. The width and height should be read from the console.
 
1. [Third digit](./05. ThirdDigit)
 - Write a program that reads an integer N from the console and prints true if the third digit of N is 7, or "false THIRD_DIGIT", where you should print the third digits of N.
 
1. [Four digits](./06. FourDigits)
 Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 2011) and performs the following:
 - Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4) and prints it on the console.
 - Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 1102) and prints the reversed number.
 - Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201) and prints the result.
 - Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 2101) and prints the result.
 
1. [Point in a circle](./07. PointInCircle)
 - Write a program that reads the coordinates of a point x and y and using an expression checks if given point (x, y) is inside a circle K({0, 0}, 2) - the center has coordinates (0, 0) and the circle has radius 2. The program should then print "yes DISTANCE" if the point is inside the circle or "no DISTANCE" if the point is outside the circle.
 - In place of DISTANCE print the distance from the beginning of the coordinate system - (0, 0) - to the given point.
 
1. [Prime check](./08. PrimeCheck)
 - Write a program that reads an integer N (which will always be less than 100 or equal) and uses an expression to check if given N is prime (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
 
1. [Trapezoids](./09. Trapezoids)
 - Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides a and b and height h. The three values should be read from the console in the order shown below. All three value will be floating-point numbers.
 
1. [Point, Circle, Rectangle](./10. PointCircleRectangle)
 - Write a program that reads a pair of coordinates x and y and uses an expression to checks for given point (x, y) if it is within the circle K({1, 1}, 1.5) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).
 
1. [3rd Bit](./11. ThirdBit)
 - Using bitwise operators, write a program that uses an expression to find the value of the bit at index 3 of an unsigned integer read from the console.
 - The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit 0.
 - The result of the expression should be either 1 or 0. Print it on the console.
 
1. [N-th Bit](./12. NthBit)
 - Write a program that reads from the console two integer numbers P and N and prints on the console the value of P's N-th bit. 
 
1. [Modify Bit](./13. ModifyBit)
 - We are given an integer number N (read from the console), a bit value v (read from the console as well) (v = 0 or 1) and a position P (read from the console). Write a sequence of operators (a few lines of C# code) that modifies N to hold the value v at the position P from the binary representation of N while preserving all other bits in N. Print the resulting number on the console.
 
1. [BitExchange](./14. BitExchange)
 - Write a program that exchanges bits 3, 4 and 5 with bits 24, 25 and 26 of given 32-bit unsigned integer(read from the console).
 
1. [BitSwap](./15. BitSwap)
 - Write a program first reads 4 numbers n, p, q and k and than swaps bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1} with bits {q, q+1, …, q+k-1} of n. Print the resulting integer on the console.
