# Chain of responsibility pattern

In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a
source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains 
logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next
processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of 
this chain.
